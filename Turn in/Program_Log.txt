functions:
addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, square, square root, dup, swap, ps, quit;

//steps
	encounter operator
	pop the appropriate number of nubmers from the stack
	perform the operation
	push result on stack

Designing what should be in my loop

//loop
	get input from user
		if exit statment set "exit = false;"
	perform oporations
		send to appropriate function
	display stack

	ReciveAndDecide(); //recives input from user and returns the char for which ever function to perform
	ActivateFunction(); //takes the char for which function is being perfomed and calls the appropriate one
		Add(); //takes no input pops twice from stack perfoms the funciton stated and then puts in on the stack
	DisplayTop(); //prints out top of the stack


//10-18 
	coosing to combine the push functions and perfom so that it sends it to the function desider inside of the push function
	by doing this i can perform multiple special actions from one line.

-Problem
	i tried to design the seperation of the users statment before i decieded the best way to call the appropriate functions
	this was a mistake because then i had to deconstruct it into peices for how i actually wanted to implitment the OperateFunc() function
